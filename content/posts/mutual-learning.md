summary:
  D&I focussed measures for teaching technical skills fail to provide students with the skills needed to challenge the prevailing silicon valley orthodoxy. Here I suggest can be mitigated by adopting a model of mutual aid for new and existing tech workers, with personal agency centred throughout.

First, we recite the rites:

Technology is eating the world. VC's throw money at anything with a pulse and a pitch deck, seeking the final shreds of alpha on a burning planet. For the players, the game is endless; for the rest of the world, the illusion of progress allows the worlds richest men to parasitise every other endeavour.

This said, technology is not fundamentally bad; only the society that uses it. And allowing subset of society to access the decision making process amplifies the damage. Diversity and inclusion activities begin to build more equal cultures, but if the D&I tools are sabotaged then this is only performative.

Here I argue (badly) that introductory technical resources can be, in many cases, not fit for purpose - and a possible way to evaluate those resources.

Tech teaching content should follow a mutual aid model. The justifications for this mirror those for material community support. A charity-based aid system produces and enforces a false system of donors and recipients; builds new class barriers; and thereby fragments communities and renders us all weaker and more distrustful. In contrast mutual aid organisations provide frameworks for cooperation and emphasise that all participants are by definition community members, and that the definition of a community is that which everyone contributes to.

For me, there are aspects of the tech community that reflect both tendencies. Many technical sub communities provide incredible support. The best start with a bias towards openness, with discoveries recognised first by how well they are communicated and provided to the community - here, small communities have an advantage.

# The worst examples

Tech boot camps act as an almost perfect counterexample (https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/stem-coding-bootcamp-education-scam-philanthropy) to mutual aid. Firstly the concept of the boot-camp is both faux-charitable and neoliberal, with a focus on maximising the value that ends up back with the owners of the firms the graduates go to join; this progresses in several ways. First, some VC funded boot camps are "funded" by imposing a tax on graduates; this loops that wage directly back to same same VC pool that funded the employer. 

Additionally, I worry that the skills selected for inclusion in boot camps and other accelerated pathways to jobs tend to minimise the risk of not landing an entry level role at FAANG. This may not be in the best interests of the students; it may act to restrict the career pathways available. Within quantum the focus on the circuit model I also feel reflects what's easy to teach and clearly quantum; ignoring that it's like teaching someone to program with front-panel toggle switches during the UNIX revolution.

I would suggest someone keen on joining QC either focuses on a (plausible!) application area or on the hardware scaling processes; knowledge that does not come with a clear expiry date. This damage this causes will compound; successes generate opportunities, and an out-of-date knowledge base cuts off the opportunity before it starts.

# The best examples

Lynn Conway's VSLI design revolution (http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Memoirs/VLSI/SSCM/VLSI_Reminiscences.pdf) captures how well knowledge transfer can work to create a community. The MPC79 project didn't just teach people rules, it gave people confidence to build further; and the feedback loop this created launched the VSLI revolution.

The Recurse Center rejects this model of classification. It's marketed as accessible to all technical backgrounds; but this leads to an elite bias. 3 months of mutual learning is really perfect, but it should be an opportunity available to all. A UBI or a trivial-to-apply-for education-linked stipend would make this project far more radical.

# Routes forward

D&I projects should be prioritised, and the knowledge shared should be past the cutting edge - the students should be the vanguard of a revolution, not "human capital" to mitigate a "skills shortfall", also known as wage suppression.

Those with power should be alert to competing ideas, and should welcome the chance to step away. This mirrors recent calls for improving boardroom diversity by asking the incumbents to step down; term limits on tech leadership could lead to a much more representative community at all levels.
