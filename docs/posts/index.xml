      <description>As part of Noa Z&amp;rsquo;s course, we modified the NetFPGA SUME reference design to support cut-through low latency switching at 10G line rate.
As part of this project a new output port lookup module was written in CλaSH, a Haskell derived DSL compiling to Verilog. The pipelined design was exceptionally succinct when compared to the reference Verilog design.
The document is a literate haskell walk-through of the OPL module, for use as a building block for other pipelined systems.</description>

      <description>A high performance quantum circuit simulator in CλaSH Introduction For my master&amp;rsquo;s project, I aimed to develop a FPGA based quantum simulator with the objective of running &amp;gt;30 qubits at reasonable depth on a single Amazon F1 instance. Whilst the full-scale tests never happened, a tested general simulator was produced and was validated at 16 qubits on Zynq hardware. This series of blog posts will describe the simulation method and the use of CλaSH as a tool for rapid development of hardware networks.</description>
